## Responsiveness
During development each page was tested using dev tools in Google Chrome. The strategy involved ensuring that every page would adapt to various screen sizes beyond a width of 320px, as opposed to relying on fixed device-specific widths.
Further testing was done on mobile to confirm all is working as expected.
